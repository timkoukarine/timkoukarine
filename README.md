### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at UofT in my fourth year, persuing a specialist in Finance and Economics with a focus in Data Science, and minoring in Computer Science.

I am interested in ML applications in finance and looking forward to sharing some projects here in the future.

Thanks that's all!
Tim
